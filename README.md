**Job:** System Reverse Engineer
**Project:** Glass Box

### **THE PROBLEM**

**1. Context: Division of Labor turned the world into Black Boxes.**
The modern world is built on the Division of Labor. It made society efficient, but it fragmented reality. Today, systems are so complex that no single person—and certainly no busy citizen—sees how the whole machine works. We are left with Black Boxes: we see the inputs and outputs, but the mechanism that connects them is invisible.

**2. Incentive: Leaders are optimized for survival, not yours.**
**Securing power is the prerequisite to implementing ideals.** Before a leader can fix anything, they must first cement their position. **Natural selection prefers** those who prioritize survival over ideals.
*   **Rule #1:** Securing and maintaining power.
*   **Rule #2:** Implement ideals (only when it doesn't violate Rule #1).

**3. Result: Black Box + Leader's Survival = Exploited People.**
Leaders need your resources (votes, taxes, labor, support, money) to stay in power. Their strategy changes depending on what you can see:

*   **When the mechanism is CLEAR:**
    Leaders must distribute value back to **you**. To secure your support, they are forced to satisfy **you**.

*   **When the mechanism is HIDDEN:**
    Leaders reduce the distribution to **you**. Because you cannot check what you cannot see, satisfying you becomes a **wasted investment**.

Instead, leaders divert resources to the factors that increase their odds of survival. **The Black Box enables this exploitation.**

Often, the exploitation isn't even intentional. A leader understands the Black Box of survival—how to secure support and resources. But to make the right call for you, they must evaluate hundreds of other Black Boxes (economics, technology, history). This is an overwhelmingly difficult task. **They exploit you not from evil intent, but because they simply can't understand the hundreds of Black Boxes required to serve you.**

### **THE SOLUTION**

**We reverse engineer the Black Box.**
We cannot hope for leaders with infinite capacity and **self-sacrificing morals**. But we can solve these impossibilities with a single structural fix: **Dismantle the Complexity.** We trace the incentives, map the resource flows, and **visualize the causal chains.**

**We turn the Black Box into a Glass Box.**
*   **Leaders** get a clear view of the mechanism to improve your life.
*   **You** get a clear view of what leaders are doing and where to give feedback.

We change the rules of survival. When the mechanism is visible, satisfying you becomes the prerequisite for maintaining power.
**We end the exploitation of you.**
